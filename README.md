# Matrix

Step 1. Download zip file and unzip files in a folder.
Step 2. Install Node.JS and Python. During both installations, make sure both are set to the environment paths. If any of them are missing
you can add them in Control Panel –> System Properties –> Environment Variables-> Paths -> Edit and then the path of the missing program.
Step 3. Open up Node.JS command prompt and change directory to the Matrix-Master folder, or to what the unzipped folder is named.
Step 4. Run the command "node server.js", open a new web page and enter http://127.0.0.1:8081/ in the address bar. Click the button to generate a nxn matrix and see the results of the highest sequence and product of that sequence
Note: due to n being random, it may take a few seconds for the results to return.
